## rtlsdr-test1 - Catching a pulse signal from a water meter transmitter using RTL-SDR

My first test of RTL-SDR to read signals from a water meter transmitter

This is supposed to be a follow-up to my [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RTLSDR/comments/iajgbi/how_to_catch_a_short_and_potentially_very/) in r/RTLSDR sub


Some links for the context:
